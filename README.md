Attempting again with flexbox

This was my third attempt at using flexbox for layout. While I am no where near becoming a master, I finally am getting the hang of some of the bigger concepts, and got some valuabvle take-aways:
  - Don't try to use just one big box: you're going to be using quite a few different flex containers.
  - If you want more specific control of layout on different lines, make sure each line is its own box, and get everything on the line wrapped within it in the HTML.
  - display: flex ONLY WORKS BETWEEN PARENTS AND CHILDREN, for the love of all that's holy.
  - percentages can be your friend.
  - they can also be your enemy.
  - there is still a place for absolute measurement units: if you want the spacial relationship between object to not change, no matter what happens to the page, make that unit absolute.
  - be persistent and keep trying to figure it out: if other people can do it, there is a solution. There's probably a decent solution even if it seems like other people can't figure it out.
